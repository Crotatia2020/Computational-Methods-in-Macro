Since, at the core of these equilibrium conditions, we will have the Euler equations for the agents in the model that encode optimal behavior (with the other condi- tions being somewhat mechanical), this approach is commonly known as the Euler equation method (sometimes also referred to as solving the equilibrium conditions of the models). This solution strategy is extremely general and it allows us to handle non-Pareto efficient economies without further complications."
